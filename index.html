      <h1 class="body">Description</h1>
      <p class="text">
        A large, sloppy, long-necked Great Egret. The large size and black legs help distinguish it
        from other herons. It is widespread all over the world and is quite common. The color of the
        beak depends on the area of distribution: it is always yellow in the United States and black
        elsewhere during the breeding season. It is found in shallow wetlands such as ponds, swamps
        and tidal flats. Slowly catch prey in shallow water. Often seen alone, they can also be
        found in large numbers in food-rich areas. It is a colony variety and is often mixed with
        other herons and egrets.

      <h2 class="body">Diet</h2>
      <p class="text">
        They mainly stand or walk in shallow waters looking for food, waiting for fish to approach,
        and then quickly kicking and catching their beaks. You can eat herds, feed with other
        herons, cormorants, and crested ibises, and sometimes steal food from small birds. We also
        sometimes search in open fields near cows. Mostly fish. Aside from fish, also eats
        crustaceans, frogs, salamanders, snakes, aquatic insects. In open fields may catch
        grasshoppers, rodents. Has been seen catching small rails and other birds.

      <h3 class="body">Sub Species</h3>
      <p class="text">
        Four slightly different variants occur in different parts of the world. These differences
        include the light color and size of the breeding season. The smallest variant, A. a. Modesta
        is native to Asia and Australasia, and while some taxonomists consider it a complete
        species, the Great Egret (Ardea modesta) in the east, most scientists treat it as a
        subspecies. A.a. Alvarinne, 1758-Nominated, found throughout Europe and the Palearctic
        Realm. A.a. Egretta Gmelin, JF, 1789-Discovered in the United States A.a. melanorhynchos
        Wagler, 1827-discovered in Africa A.a. Modesta Gray, JE, 1831 â€“ Great Egret found in India,
        Southeast Asia, East Asia, Oceania

      <h4 class="body">Cool Facts</h4>
      <ul class="text">
        <li>
          The egret is a symbol of the Audubon Association, one of the oldest environmental groups
          in North America.
        </li>
        <li>
          Audubon was founded to prevent birds from being killed for their feathers. Not all young
          hatchlings survive the cuddling period.
        </li>
        <li>
          Attacks while snuggling are common, and large chicks often kill their little siblings.
          This behavior, known as sibriside, is not uncommon in birds such as hawks, owls, and sagi,
          and is often due to poor breeding conditions in certain years.
        </li>
        <li>
          The pristine white Great Egret becomes even more attractive during the breeding season.
          The skin patch on his face turns neon green and long feathers grow from his back. These
          feathers, called aigrettes, were a source of heron worries in the late 19th century when
          such ornaments were praised for women's hats.
        </li>
        <li>
          Great egrets are often the first species to arrive in mixed-species colonies, and their
          presence can lead to nesting of other species.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Great Egret flies slowly but powerfully. With two flapping wings per second, the
          cruising speed is 40km / h.
        </li>
        <li>
          Egret hunts mainly while playing in the water, but sometimes swims to catch prey or floats
          on the (slightly painstaking) surface of the water looking for fish.
        </li>
        <li>The oldest known egret was 22 years and 10 months old and was tied in Ohio.</li>

      <article class="text">
        In North America, a large number of Great Egret were killed in the late 1800s to allow
        feathers called "Aigrettes" to be used to decorate hats. After that, the number recovered
        due to conservation activities. Its range extends to northern Canada. However, in some parts
        of the southern United States, numbers are declining due to habitat loss, especially
        drainage, grazing, deforestation, burning, increased salinity, groundwater extraction, and
        wetland degradation due to the invasion of alien plants. increase. Nevertheless, this
        species adapts well to human habitat and is easily visible near wetlands and waters in urban
        and suburban areas. Great egrets partially migrate, and birds in the Northern Hemisphere
        migrate from cold winter regions to the south. It is one of the species covered by the
        Agreement on the Conservation of African and Eurasian Migratory Birds (AEWA). In 1953, the
        Flying Egret was chosen as a symbol of the Audubon Society, which was partially established
        to prevent birds from being killed for their feathers. On May 22, 2012, it was announced
        that a pair of Great Egret would nest for the first time in the Shapwick Heath Nature
        Reserve in Somerset, England. This species is a rare visitor to the United Kingdom, and BBC
        Ben Abyss explained that the news could mean that the first large heron colony was
        established in the United Kingdom. The following week, Natural England's Kevin Anderson
        confirmed that the Great Egret chick had hatched and set a new record for breeding birds in
        the United Kingdom. In 2017, 17 young birds fled in seven nests in Somerset, and a second
        nest was announced in Holkham National Nature Reserve, Norfolk. In January 2021, Bird
        Guides, which reports rare bird sightings on UK websites and magazines, removed this species
        from the national rare bird list due to the sheer volume of sightings. In 2018, Finland's
        first pair of Great Egret nested and raised four young birds in a colony of Porvoo herons.
